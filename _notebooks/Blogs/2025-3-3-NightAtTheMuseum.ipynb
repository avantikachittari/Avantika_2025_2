    "Based on the feedback that I got from N@TM the most common thing that was told about my game was that the levels didn't really go together and didn't have much of a story telling aspect from them. From my perspective, the feedback on my game has been really helpful. Players enjoy the graphics, free-roaming feature, and overall design, but they’ve pointed out areas for improvement. I see that clearer instructions and better integration of questions into the gameplay are needed. Adding features like a health bar, small quests, and more level-based challenges would make the game more engaging. Pausing the game when answering questions is a great idea, and I’ll also work on refining the animations. Overall, I appreciate the suggestions and will use them to improve my game."
